    <p class="paragraf-1">"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing 
        pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete 
        account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great 
        explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one 
        rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,
        but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally 
        encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there 
        anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because 
        it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil 
        and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example,
        which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain 
        some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who 
        chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who 
        avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
